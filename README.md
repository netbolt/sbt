About this Repo

This is the Synereo Git repro for the sbt.sh start script. The script is used to run sbt-launch.jar.

The file is used during the Synereo Docker image build, eliminating the need for manual installation of SBT.

See http://www.scala-sbt.org/0.13/docs/Manual-Installation.html for more information.
